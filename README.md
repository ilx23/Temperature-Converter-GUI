## Introduction:

Welcome to the Temperature Converter GUI project! This project provides a simple Graphical User Interface (GUI) for converting temperatures between Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin. Users can easily input a temperature in one unit and instantly see the equivalent temperatures in the other units.

## Features:

1. **User-Friendly Interface:** The GUI offers an intuitive interface for users to input temperatures and view conversions quickly.

2. **Temperature Conversion:** Users can input temperatures in Celsius, Fahrenheit, or Kelvin and instantly see the equivalent temperatures in the other units.

3. **Real-Time Conversion:** As users input temperatures, the conversions are calculated and displayed in real-time, providing instant feedback.

## How to Use:

1. **Clone the Repository:** Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:
> ```git clone https://github.com/ilx23/Temperature-Converter-GUI.git```

2. **Install Dependencies:** Ensure you have Python installed on your machine. This project does not require any additional dependencies.

3. **Run the Application:** Navigate to the project directory and run the following command:
> ```python app.py```

4. **Input Temperature:** Enter the temperature value in the input field and select the unit of measurement (Celsius, Fahrenheit, or Kelvin).

5. **View Conversions:** As you input the temperature, the equivalent temperatures in the other units will be displayed in real-time.
